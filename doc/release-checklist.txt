Things for Hatari dev team to check before new release:

When first thinking about new release:
* Ask about compatibility / bug fixes & features that people would
  like to see in next release
* Ask people on hatari-devel to build latest Hatari and do some
  preliminary testing with their favorite use-cases
* Get list of things we want to push in before the release
  - Make sure that any other larger changes are post-poned
    after release
* Run automated tests:
  - Do "make test"
  - Run TOS boot tester for all supported TOS versions

Few weeks before release, after issues from above have been fixed:
* Validate HTML documentation with https://validator.w3.org/
* Check that (Python) hatariui still works with latest changes
* Check that all programs/demos listed in compatibility.html as
  fixed during development still work, change their Hatari version
  to new release and make sure they're listed also in release-notes.txt
* Make sure that different Hatari build configurations work
  (all and none of optional dependencies being present, all optional
  featured enabled and disabled,  WinUAE & oldUAE CPU cores, SDL1 & SDL2)
* Re-run automated tests
* Go through commit log / ask others to make sure relevant changes
  are listed in release-notes.txt, and updated in todo.txt
* Ask Linux distro maintainers to try packaging Hatari and report
  issues that need to be fixed before release
* Build binary packages for OSes that aren't covered by the daily builds
* Announce release candidate on mailing lists & Atari forum and
  ask people to test it on all platforms.  Remember to tell which
  platforms should work, and which are still completely untested

Actual release:
* Update release version & date in:
  - version.h
  - manual.html
  - readme.txt
  - release-notes.txt
* Get latest etos512.img version for binary packages and document
  that in emutos.txt
* Build binary packages
* Announce new release "everywhere"
* Party!
